# Typeflow AngularJS Playground

This is a simple playground I'm currently using for testing
the typeahead functionality.

It may become useful for others in the future, hopefully.

Setup
-----

Under [/support](/support) there is an example Nginx server file
for running both this playground and the API and have them communicate.
